PROTO 0
TODO
mode of operation. 1 bit. smart or just all numbers

PROTO 1
8 bits representing the smallest number

PROTO 2
4 bits represent the maximal number of bits to represent all the numbers after adjusting with subtracting 
the smaller number it is maximum of 8 (2 ** 8 = 256 > 255) and 8 is 1000 in binary
that number will be abreviated as M

PROTO 3
8 bits representing the length of the matrix


now the sequence follows for every instance of number
PROTO 4
- M bits that encode the number

following is the describtion of a tree that is creating the island of numbers
 - 4 bits representing the directions.
 - getBitSize(matrixLength) bits of streak;
